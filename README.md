## Analysis Report

### The dataset used in this analysis consisted of 11 variables and over 400 records. It was synthetic and generated to mirror real-world conditions. The variables included in this dataset are as follows:

* Sales: These are the unit sales at each location and are represented in thousands.
* Competitor Price: This represents the price charged by competitors at each location.
* Income: This is the community income level, represented in thousands of dollars.
* Advertising: This is the local advertising budget for the company at each location, also represented in thousands of dollars.
* Population: The size of the population in the region is represented in thousands.
* Price: This is the price that the company charges for car seats at each site.
* Shelf Location: This is a factor indicating the quality of the shelving location for the car seats at each site. It has levels such as Bad, Good, and Medium.
* Age: This represents the average age of the local population.
* Education: This variable represents the education level at each location.
* Urban: This is a factor indicating whether the store is in an urban or rural location. It has two levels: Yes and No.
* US: This is a factor indicating whether the store is located in the US or not. It also has two levels: Yes and No.
## Data Preprocessing

The analysis began with data preprocessing, which involved loading the data using the pandas library, a powerful tool in Python for data manipulation and analysis. The categorical variables (Shelf Location, Urban, and US) in the dataset were one-hot encoded. One-hot encoding is a process of converting categorical data into a format that could be provided to ML algorithms to improve predictions. The one-hot encoding process converted each of these categories into separate binary (0 or 1) variables.

Following this, the dataset was split into input features (X) and the target variable (y). The input features included all the variables in the dataset except for 'Sales,' which was the target variable. This division of data is crucial for supervised learning models, where the goal is to learn a mapping function that maps the input variables (X) to the output variable (y).

Subsequently, the data was further divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used for the machine learning model to learn from, while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. This is a standard practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.

## Model Building and Evaluation

In the model building phase, two models were implemented: the Random Forest model and the Gradient Boosting model. Both these models are powerful machine learning algorithms used for regression problems, like the one at hand.

The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning method, which operates by building multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees for regression problems. On the other hand, Gradient Boosting is another ensemble technique that builds new models that aim to correct the errors made by the existing ensemble.

The performance of these models was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric, a popular choice for regression problems. It measures the average magnitude of the error, i.e., the differences between the predicted and observed values.

## Results

The results obtained from the analysis provided insightful information. The Random Forest model yielded an RMSE of 1.0773, and the

Gradient Boosting model yielded an RMSE of 1.0825. These results were tabulated and saved in the "results.xlsx" Excel file for future reference and analysis.

While both models yielded similar RMSE scores, the Random Forest model performed slightly better than the Gradient Boosting model. This suggests that the Random Forest model was more accurate in predicting the sales based on the given attributes.

However, it's important to note that the difference between the RMSE scores of the two models was very minimal. This suggests that both models performed robustly and could potentially be used interchangeably depending on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

In conclusion, this sales analysis task was performed comprehensively using a systematic approach, which included rigorous data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Both the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models were found to be robust and accurate in predicting sales based on the given attributes.

However, it's worth noting that the process of building a machine learning model is iterative, and there is always room for improvement. For future work, it would be worthwhile to explore other machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Neural Networks, which could potentially yield better results.

Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models could also lead to improved performance. Hyperparameters are the parameters of the model that are set before the learning process begins, and optimizing them can help achieve the best complexity-performance trade-off.

Lastly, performing feature importance analysis could provide valuable insights. Feature importance refers to techniques that assign a score to input features based on how useful they are at predicting a target variable. By understanding which features are the most impactful in predicting sales, we could focus our resources and strategies on these areas to maximize sales.

In summary, while the current analysis has provided robust models and insightful results, there is a multitude of opportunities for further exploration and improvement in future work.




The analysis report also includes results from the implementation of a Linear Regression model. The Linear Regression model was trained on the same dataset and evaluated using the RMSE metric. The resulting RMSE score for Linear Regression model was 1.0439558088899785, which is slightly lower than the RMSE scores of both the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. This suggests that the Linear Regression model was the most accurate of the three in predicting sales based on the given attributes.

Additionally, an exhaustive grid search was conducted to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model. The grid search was performed over three folds for each of 36 different combinations of parameters, totaling 108 fits. The best parameters were found to be a max_depth of None, min_samples_split of 10, and n_estimators of 50. However, interestingly, the Random Forest model with these optimal parameters had a slightly higher RMSE of 1.103818152772359, indicating that the model's performance decreased slightly when these specific parameters were applied.

Moreover, a feature importance analysis was performed to determine which attributes had the most significant impact on the sales prediction. The top five features, in order of importance, were found to be:

- Competitor_Price with an importance score of 0.185389.
- Age with an importance score of 0.156804.
- Education with an importance score of 0.134846.
- Price with an importance score of 0.129189.
- Income with an importance score of 0.118526.
* These results indicate that the price charged by competitors had the highest influence on sales prediction. The other influential features include demographic attributes such as the average age and education level of the local population, the price the company charges for car seats, and the community income level. This suggests that both economic factors and demographic characteristics play a significant role in predicting sales in different locations.

The detailed results and insights gathered from this analysis can guide future business strategies. For instance, understanding the importance of competitor pricing could lead to more effective pricing strategies. Similarly, insights about the significance of demographic factors could guide marketing and advertising efforts. Despite some variations in the performance of the different models, each provided valuable insights and can be used as a reliable tool for predicting sales based on various attributes.
